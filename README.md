Of course. Here is a complete README.md file for your Caesar Cipher project. You can copy and paste this text directly into a file named README.md in your project folder.

Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool üîê
This is a simple, interactive command-line program written in Python that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

Features ‚ú®
Encrypt Mode: Transforms your plain text into a secret ciphered message.

Decrypt Mode: Converts a ciphered message back into readable plain text.

Custom Shift Key: You can specify any integer as the shift value for the cipher.

Handles All Characters: The program preserves capitalization, punctuation, spaces, and numbers, only shifting the alphabetic characters.

User-Friendly: A simple and intuitive command-line interface guides you through the process.
